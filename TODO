0.6.0 TODO (in no particular order)
===
- Catch case with reader_orientation set and not reader_lines

- Make tag lists configurable
    * Make Tag() init use kwargs
    * Keep a list of pre-configured Tags in cfg,
        so that filters/sorts etc. can be set before
        the Tag object is actually needed.
        - Wrap that in a nice config wrapper

- Attempt to force strange drawing errors before release (not sure
        if they'll come up when I'm not crashing around under the hood)

- Website docs

- Code doc review

- Round out tests
    * Better way to test graphical output?
    * Doctests?
