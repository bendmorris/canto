0.6.0 TODO (in no particular order)
===
- Catch case with reader_orientation set and not reader_lines

- Make tag lists configurable

- Ensure that all feed-specific sort/filter-type operations can
    be done with a keybind, rather than cycling through a list
        X - Done for global/feed filters

- Attempt to force strange drawing errors before release (not sure
        if they'll come up when I'm not crashing around under the hood)

- Website docs

- Code doc review

- Round out tests
    * Better way to test graphical output?
    * Doctests?
