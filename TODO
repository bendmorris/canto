0.6.0 TODO (in no particular order)
===
- Determine whether "reader stacking" is illegal OR implement a better way to
denote how many readers are open.
    * Status bar?
        - This would solve a number of problems other than this one. For
        example, 90% of the time the message bar is blank and useless, it would
        be a good way to fill the space.

- Refactor interface_draw calls to take **kwargs or a dict
    * Use "focus" in style somehow
    * Complete any other breakage

- Round out tests
    * Better way to test graphical output?
    * Doctests?

- Import the Textpad code into the codebase and modify for UTF-8 input and
better prompt support.

- Either wrap : commands OR import only safe functions OR explicitly make it
debug-only (i.e. add a flag to enable them).
