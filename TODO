0.6.0 TODO (in no particular order)
===
- Refactor interface_draw calls to take **kwargs or a dict
    * Use "focus" in style somehow
    * Complete any other breakage

- Add ability to skip directly to feed #n

- Round out tests
    * Better way to test graphical output?
    * Doctests?

- Either wrap : commands OR import only safe functions OR explicitly make it
debug-only (i.e. add a flag to enable them).
