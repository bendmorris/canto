0.6.0 TODO (in no particular order)
===
- Attempt to force strange drawing errors before release (not sure
        if they'll come up when I'm not crashing around under the hood)
    * Could be fixed... haven't seen it happen since the code calmed down.
      in particular, fixing the alarm signalling.

- Config cleanups (inconsistencies found while documenting)
    * tag_sort
    * change_feed needs to operate on URLs, not tags anymore

- Website docs
    * status needs to be documented
    * advconfig needs to be re-formatted

- Code doc review

- Round out tests
    * Better way to test graphical output?
    * Doctests?
