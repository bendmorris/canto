0.6.0 TODO (in no particular order)
===
- Refactor interface_draw calls to take **kwargs or a dict
    * Use "focus" in style somehow
    * Complete any other breakage

- Change add_feed to take one argument, moving tag into kwargs as a list

- Make tag lists configurable

- Round out tests
    * Better way to test graphical output?
    * Doctests?
