# Configuration

This is the section covering most features of Canto and how to use them. This
only covers the basics and how to use pre-written goodies (filters, sorts,
etc.) from `canto.extra`. Actually writing custom content is covered
elsewhere.

## Adding feeds

<div class="section">

### `add()`

`add` is the basic building block of your config. As the name would suggest, it
adds a feed to Canto. 99% of the time, a call like this will get the job done:

    :::python
    add("http://someurl")

You can also tweak some other settings having to do with fetching the feed. The
`rate` and `keep` variables effect the rate at which the feed is fetched from
the server and `keep` determines how many items should be kept. The following
line will update a feed every 30 minutes and keep up to a 100 items.

    :::python
    add("http://someurl", rate=30, keep=100)

> **NOTE**: "keep" will be silently ignored if it's below the number of items
> in the feed. In fact, by default `keep = 0`. This behavior differs from 
> 0.6.x.

> The default `rate` is 5 for fetching from the server every five minutes.

### Password protected feeds

If the feed is behind browser authentication (i.e. when you try to reach it in a
browser it brings up a username/password box), you can specify those in the feed
definition too.

    :::python
    add("http://someprotectedurl", username="myuser", password="mypass")

> **NOTE**: In order to protect sensitive information in your config, it's
> standard practice to `chmod 600 ~/.canto/conf` so that other users can't 
> read your password even if they can read your home directory. However, 
> Canto will not enforce these permissions as some other programs.

There are a few other options for `add`, but these are more logically covered
elsewhere.

### "Sourcing" other files

Canto supports adding feeds from other file formats. This can be useful when
trying to keep URLs synced between readers. Canto can source OPML files at
runtime simply by giving a path to the OPML file.

    :::python
    source_opml("/home/myuser/feeds.opml")

Canto can also source plain lists of URLs, delimited by newlines.

    :::python
    source_urls("/home/myuser/urls")

Feeds that are sourced are added with the equivalent of a basic `add` call
with a URL. If you want to add other attributes to feeds that have been added
this way, then you can use `change_feed` that takes the same arguments as 
`add` does.

### Tweaking defaults

Sometimes you want to change the `rate` and `keep` for a lot of feeds at once.
Using `default_rate` and `default_keep` you can set those parameters for 
**every feed following the call**. Because it's every feed added after the
call, it can be used to set it for batches of feeds, rather than all feeds.
If you want the all feed behavior, set the defaults before you define any
feeds.

> **NOTE**: To reiterate from above, `rate` is in minutes and `keep` will 
> ignore any number lower than the number of items in the feed's source.

The following is a good application of using the default calls:

    :::python

    default_rate(30)    # News feeds
    add("http://news1")
    add("http://news2")
    ...

    default_rate(120)   # Slow blog feeds
    add("http://blog1")
    add("http://blog2")
    ...

    default_rate(1)     # Quick feed
    default_keep(100)   # Lots of items could be missed
    add("http://quick1")
    add("http://quick2")
    ...

Without setting anything, rate is set to five minutes (5) and keep is set to 
0, which indicates that all the items in the feed source should be kept and no
more than that.

## Browsing

<div class="section">

Canto supports using external programs to open any content found in an item.
Typically, you just want to set a `link_handler` to your favorite browser.

    :::python
    link_handler("firefox \"%u\"")

This will use firefox as your browser. The `\"%u\"` will be replaced with the
URL. Users that want to use a text based browser like
[elinks](http://elink.or.cz), have to tell Canto to relinquish the terminal
while you use it, like so:

    :::python
    link_handler("elinks \"%u\"", text=True)

If you find yourself bouncing between the Linux console and an X terminal,
you can use a bit of logic to automatically set the browser based on the
`TERM` environmental variable.

    :::python
    import os
    if os.getenv("TERM") == "linux":
        link_handler("elinks \"%u\"", text=True)    # Text-only
    else:
        link_handler("firefox \"%u\"")              # X terminal

### Non-HTML content

Links to PDFs and other content you'd rather view in a program other than
your browser (like enclosures) can be setup by using `link_handler` with an
extension. For example, to open and .mp3 in a podcast:

    :::python
    link_handler("mplayer -someoptions \"%u\"", ext="mp3")

Fortunately, mplayer can stream from the web by default. Some applications
require the content to be fetched before hand. This can be dealt with using
the `fetch` parameter. For example, to open a .pdf in evince, which doesn't
support opening from the internet directly:

    :::python
    link_handler("evince \"%u\"", ext="pdf", fetch=True)

Canto will then fetch the content into `/tmp` and run the associated program.

### Images

Images are handled similarly to links with the `image_handler` call. It takes
the same arguments as `link_handler`. A good example:

    :::python
    image_handler("fbv \"%u\"", text=True, fetch=True)

This will use `fbv` to view an image in a text console.

> NOTE: Image links are denoted by the color blue in the reader

# Using Advanced Features

Canto is extremely powerful due to its internal use of the Python
interpreter for all of its configuration. The details of writing extension
content is covered elsewhere, but there is a lot of good stuff included
with the source.

## Importing canto.extra

<div class="section">

The first step before you use any extra content is to import it. In fact,
the very first line in any config that has any customization to it at all
is going to be:

    :::python
    from canto.extra import *

This will make all of the goodies packaged with Canto available to your
config.

</div>

## Filters

<div class="section">

The most useful extra feature Canto provides is its powerful filter system.
`canto.extra` provides a number of filters to use

<table>
<tr>
<td><pre>None</pre></td>
<td>Filter no items.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>show_unread</pre></td>
<td>Ignore all items that have been marked read</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>show_marked</pre></td>
<td>Ignore all items that are unmarked</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>only_with("string")</pre></td>
<td>Show only items that have "string" in the title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>only_without("string")</pre></td>
<td>Show only items that **don't** have "string" in the title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>all_of(filter1, filter2, ...)</pre></td>
<td>Show only items that pass all listed filters (binary and)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>any_of(filter1, filter2, ...)</pre></td>
<td> Show items that pass any of the listed filters (binary or).</td>
</tr>
</table>

There's also `with_tag_in`, which is covered in the tag section, specifically.

There are three ways to apply filters.

- **Global filters**. These apply regardless. Any items that you see in the
interface had to pass this filter. These are useful for filters based on state
like `show_unread`.

- **Tag filters**. These filters only apply to specific tags (covered in the 
tag section).

- **Feed filters**. These are filters applied when loading content from disk.
Items that don't pass this filter will never appear in the interface. These
are useful when you want to ignore a whole set of items entirely. Like news
posts in webcomic feeds.

### Using Global Filters

Global filters are arguably the most useful, and invariably the first use
that users think for it is filtering out items that they've read.
Accomplishing that is simple:

    :::python
    filters=[show_unread]

That will filter all read items out by default when you open Canto. If you
still want to have access to all items, you can add the `None` filter to the
list:

    :::python
    filters=[show_unread, None]

Then you can switch between `show_unread` and `None` using `[` and `]` to
cycle through the list.

If you're more comfortable using a keybind to choose your global filters,
then you can use `set_filter`. This allows you to set the global filter
regardless of whether it's in the `filters` list:

    :::python
    keys['1'] = set_filter(show_unread)
    keys['2'] = set_filter(show_marked)
    keys['3'] = set_filter(None)

This lets you use the 1, 2, and 3 keys to set your filters directly, without
needing to cycle through the list.

### Using Feed Filters

Most of the time, feed filters are only useful if you want to completely
ignore some easily filtered content in a feed. My favorite example is
ignoring all non-comic items in a webcomic feed. Take
[penny-arcade](http://penny-arcade.com)'s feed for example. Each item's
title is clearly marked with "Comic:" or "News:".

If I wanted just completely ignore non-comic items, I could modify the `add`
call for Penny Arcade to use the `only_with` filter:

    :::python
    add("http://feeds.penny-arcade.com/pa-mainsite", filter=only_with("Comic:"))

That will eliminate all items that don't have "Comic:" in the title. Other
examples would be watching distro package feeds for only a certain type
of package (i.e. Gentoo, `only_with("sys-devel")`), or filtering porn torrents
out of torrent site feeds (`only_without("XXX")`, provided they're clearly
marked).

## Tags (WIP)

<div class="section">

The most basic building block of Canto is the "tag".

> TAG: The internal representation of a group of items. Represented by a box
> in the interface.

By default, canto automatically defines one tag per feed, and that tag has
the same title as the feed specifies in its source. Tags **are not 
necessarily** feeds though and can be combinations of feeds as well.

### Manipulating default tags

As mentioned above, by default there is one tag per feed using the feed's
self-specified title. You can change the name of this tag by overriding the
first tag in the `add` call. So, if you wanted to change the title of a feed
from "reddit.com: what's new online!" to "Reddit", you could change the `add`
call like this:

    :::python
    add("http://reddit.com/.rss", tags=["Reddit"])

And the default interface would show "Reddit" instead of the overly long
built-in title.

### Tag collisions

Sometimes, when you have feeds generated by a generator or multiple URLs for
one feed, default tags can be identical. In this case, the tag of the second
definition is changed to "Colliding Tag (2)". This behavior scales up to
however many colliding tags there are.

### Adding tags

You can add arbitrary string tags to feeds
