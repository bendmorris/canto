Basic configuration of Canto.

[TOC]

# Basic configuration

This is the section covering the most basic features of Canto. These are the
features that you expect of any feed reader and provide little true
customization.

## Adding feeds

<div class="section">

### `add()`

`add` is the basic building block of your config. As the name would suggest, it
adds a feed to Canto. 99% of the time, a call like this will get the job done:

    :::python
    add("http://someurl")

You can also tweak some other settings having to do with fetching the feed. The
`rate` and `keep` variables effect the rate at which the feed is fetched from
the server and `keep` determines how many items should be kept. The following
line will update a feed every 30 minutes and keep up to a 100 items.

    :::python
    add("http://someurl", rate=30, keep=100)

> NOTE: "keep" will be silently ignored if it's below the number of items in
> the feed. In fact, by default `keep = 0`.

If the feed is behind browser authentication (i.e. when you try to reach it in a
browser it brings up a username/password box), you can specify those in the feed
definition too.

    :::python
    add("http://someprotectedurl", username="myuser", password="mypass")

> NOTE: In order to protect sensitive information in your config, it's
> standard practice to `chmod 600 ~/.canto/conf` so that other users can't
> read your password even if they can read your home directory. However,
> Canto will not enforce these permissions as some other programs.
